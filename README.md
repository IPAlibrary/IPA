# Free iOS/iPadOS IPA Library -  2024 Updated

Here we have provided Free iOS IPA files that you may download directly. We've also compiled a list of the World's Most Trusted IPA Libraries based on popularity and features. The iPA files are reviewed everyday by a specific process and checked every four days. 
New IPA files are contributed by an AI-powered iPA bot (provided by Zee IPA Library Team).

## What is IPA File?
A.ipa file is an iOS and iPadOS application archive file that contains an iOS or iPadOS app. Each.ipa file contains a binary that can only be installed on iOS, iPadOS, or ARM-based macOS devices. 
Files with the.ipa extension can be uncompressed by changing the extension to.zip and then unzipping.

## What is IPA Library?
iPA Library is a database of IPA files containing games, Cydia apps, tweaked apps, and customized(Tweaked) versions of applications unavailable¬†on the default Apple AppStore.

## Is ipa library safe??
Yes, however not all IPA libraries can be trusted. However, before downloading an IPA file from another third-party library, you should check the IPA library using our IPA LIbrary Checker Tool. 
You can also self-research the Library using reviews and social media. But, happily, we are here to provide the¬†most secure iPA files, so you do not have to worry about iPhone privacy and other issues. 
We implemented an innovative algorithm for IPA search and trained AI to verify factors in the IPA file. For example, we decrypt the iPA file and inspect each file and folder for malware and unneeded device access, among other things. 

For easy navigation, we have categories for the IPA files. Here are the main categories:

- TrollStore IPA FIles
- Tweaked IPA FIles
- Jailbreak IPA Files
- Games
- Music Apps
- Emulators

### TrollStore IPA Files: 

This repository contains the updated TrollStore IPA files. These files are primarily associated with.TiPA format. However, you can use some of them as conventional iPA files by just renaming the extension.iPA. TrollStore is a popular iPA signing tool that allows you to sign an IPA file with an iOS bug. So the major benefit of using iPA installer is that you don't have to resign or reinstall iPA files due to protect revocation. 

This permasigned jailed app can permanently install any IPA using an AMFI/CoreTrust bug. The biggest disadvantage of this Signer is the limited iOS version compatibility.¬†

The TrollStore is supported for: 14.0 beta 2 - 16.6.1, 16.7 RC (20H18), 17.0. So, if your device is running the latest iOS version, it is not currently supported. However, you can resolve the issue by installing TrollStore Alternative.
